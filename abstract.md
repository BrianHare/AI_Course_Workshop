ABSTRACT 
Educators are sometimes faced with the dilemma of "None of us have a particular background in X, but we really need to teach a course in it." This two-session workshop is aimed at the faculty member without a background in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning who is nevertheless tasked with developing and teaching an undergraduate course in it. Part I will provide a high-level overview of the field, introducing key concepts, terms, and recent developments. Part II discusses issues of syllabus, assessment, textbooks, online resources, software tools, and other curricular issues. 

The presenters have both developed and taught undergraduate AI coursesâ€”we feel your pain. Or your terror, as the case may be.
